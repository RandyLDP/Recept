#STICKY TOFFEE PUDDING

This is a lovely easy take on the classic steamed date pudding. the coconut toffee is delicious it doesnt taste of coconut but adds a wonderful earthy sweetness which has its own treacle like flavour that is typical of this cake and compliments the pudding so lovely. Best served warm with your favourite vanilla ice cream of choice with lots of the toffee drizzled over the top. Here we bake the pudding which makes the recipes easier but still keeps its typical moistness
